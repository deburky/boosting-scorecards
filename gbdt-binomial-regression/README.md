# Binomial Regression with Gradient-Boosted Trees

Author: https://github.com/deburky

This repository demonstrates three different approaches for modeling binomial regression using gradient boosting frameworks. The challenge is to fit models on data where each row represents multiple trials (e.g., `k` successes out of `n` trials) without expanding to individual Bernoulli observations.

## Problem Statement

Given aggregated binomial data:

- **Features**: $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$ 
- **Success rates**: $y_i = \frac{k_i}{n_i}$ where $k_i$ is successes and $n_i$ is trials for row $i$
- **Goal**: Fit a model that predicts the underlying probability $p_i$ for each row

> [!NOTE]  
> The **binomial negative log-likelihood** we want to minimize is:
> $$\text{NLL} = -\sum_{i=1}^{n} \left[ k_i \log(p_i) + (n_i - k_i) \log(1 - p_i) \right]$$
> where $p_i = \sigma(f_i)$ and $f_i$ is the raw prediction (logit) for row $i$.

## Approaches

### 1. XGBoost: Custom Objective (`xgboost_binomial.py`)

**Method**: Custom objective function that directly handles aggregated binomial data.

**Key Features**:
- Uses `xgb.train()` with `DMatrix` to access sample weights
- Custom objective: `grad = n_i * (p_i - y_i)`, `hess = n_i * p_i * (1 - p_i)`
- **No dataset expansion** - works directly on original aggregated data
- Most efficient approach

**Mathematical Implementation**:
```python
def binomial_objective(preds, dtrain):
    y = dtrain.get_label()  # success rates
    n = dtrain.get_weight()  # trial counts
    p = sigmoid(preds)  # predicted probabilities
    grad = n * (p - y)  # weighted gradients
    hess = n * p * (1.0 - p)  # weighted hessians
    return grad, hess
```

**Results**:

- **Aggregated**
  - binom_nll=0.353546
  - rmse=0.141912
  - train_time=1.20s
- **Expanded**:
  - binom_nll=0.353933
  - rmse=0.143209
  -train_time=2.66s
- **Difference**: Only 0.000387 in NLL

### 2. CatBoost: Two-Rows Trick (`catboost_binomial_two_trick.py`)

**Method**: Creates two training rows per original observation to represent the binomial likelihood in CatBoostClassifier.

**Key Features**:
- For each row with $k_i$ successes out of $n_i$ trials:
  - Row 1: same features, `label=1`, `weight=k_i` (successes)
  - Row 2: same features, `label=0`, `weight=n_i-k_i` (failures)
- Uses standard `Logloss` classification
- **2x dataset expansion** but avoids full Bernoulli expansion

**Mathematical Equivalence**:
The weighted logloss with these two rows equals the binomial NLL:
$$\text{Weighted LogLoss} = -\sum_{i=1}^{n} \left[ k_i \log(p_i) + (n_i - k_i) \log(1 - p_i) \right]$$

**Results**:
- **Aggregated**
  - binom_nll=0.346121
  - rmse=0.132684
  - train_time=1.86s
- **Expanded**
  - binom_nll=0.347232
  - rmse=0.134208
  - train_time=5.73s
- **Difference**: Only 0.001111 in NLL

### 3. CatBoost: Weighted CrossEntropy (`catboost_binomial.py`)

**Method**: Uses soft labels with weighted CrossEntropy loss in CatBoostClassifier

**Key Features**:
- Train with `label=y_rate` (soft labels in [0,1]) and `weight=trials`
- Uses `loss_function="CrossEntropy"` which accepts soft labels
- **No dataset expansion** - works directly on aggregated data
- Mathematically equivalent to binomial NLL up to an additive constant (the binomial coefficient term), so fully valid for optimization.
- Simpler to implement than a custom objective, though less flexible than XGBoost’s custom-objective API.

**Mathematical Interpretation**:
CrossEntropy with soft labels and weights approximates the binomial NLL:
$$\text{Weighted CrossEntropy} \approx -\sum_{i=1}^{n} n_i \left[ y_i \log(p_i) + (1 - y_i) \log(1 - p_i) \right]$$

**Results**:
- **Aggregated**
  - binom_nll=0.346645
  - rmse=0.133619
  - train_time=1.48s
- **Expanded**
  - binom_nll=0.347152
  - rmse=0.133983 
  - train_time=5.84s
- **Difference**: Only 0.000507 in NLL

## Performance Comparison

| Approach | Dataset Size | Train Time | Binom NLL (Agg) | Binom NLL (Exp) | Difference |
|----------|-------------|------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------|
| **XGBoost Custom** | 24K rows | 1.20s | 0.353546 | 0.353933 | 0.000387 |
| **CatBoost Two-Rows** | 48K rows (2x) | 1.86s | 0.346121 | 0.347232 | 0.001111 |
| **CatBoost CrossEntropy** | 24K rows | 1.48s | 0.346645 | 0.347152 | 0.000507 |

## Key Insights

### 1. **XGBoost is Most Efficient**
- No dataset expansion required
- Custom objectives work seamlessly with weights
- Fastest training time
- Perfect mathematical equivalence

### 2. **CatBoost Limitations**
- Custom objectives don't handle weights the same way as XGBoost
- Two-rows trick is a straightforward and widely applicable workaround using Logloss. It’s exactly equivalent to the binomial NLL, but it doubles the dataset size.
- CrossEntropy approach is mathematically valid (equivalent up to a constant) and simple to use, but offers less flexibility than XGBoost’s custom objectives.

### 3. **All Approaches Achieve Near-Perfect Matches**
- All three methods achieve differences < 0.001 in binomial NLL
- Demonstrates that aggregated modeling can be as accurate as full expansion
- Significant computational savings over expanding to individual trials

## Mathematical Background

### Binomial Likelihood

For aggregated binomial data, the likelihood for row $i$ is:
$$L_i = \binom{n_i}{k_i} p_i^{k_i} (1-p_i)^{n_i-k_i}$$

The negative log-likelihood becomes:
$$\text{NLL}_i = -\log L_i = -\left[ \log\binom{n_i}{k_i} + k_i \log p_i + (n_i - k_i) \log(1-p_i) \right]$$

Since the binomial coefficient is constant with respect to $p_i$, we can ignore it for optimization:
$$\text{NLL}_i \propto -\left[ k_i \log p_i + (n_i - k_i) \log(1-p_i) \right]$$

### Gradient and Hessian
For gradient boosting, we need the first and second derivatives:
$$\frac{\partial \text{NLL}_i}{\partial f_i} = n_i (p_i - y_i)$$
$$\frac{\partial^2 \text{NLL}_i}{\partial f_i^2} = n_i p_i (1-p_i)$$

where $f_i$ is the raw prediction (logit) and $p_i = \sigma(f_i)$.

## Conclusion

This repository demonstrates that **aggregated binomial modeling can be as accurate as full expansion** while being significantly more efficient. The choice of approach depends on your framework:

- **XGBoost users**: Use custom objectives (most efficient)
- **CatBoost users**: Use two-rows trick or CrossEntropy
- **Large datasets**: Avoid full expansion; use aggregated approaches

All three approaches achieve near-perfect matches with the expanded baseline, proving that aggregated modeling is both theoretically sound and practically effective.
